Basic coding standard (based on PSR-1)

-PHP Code Tags
Always use <?php ?> to delimit PHP code, not the <? ?> shorthand. 

-Indenting and Line Length
While not recommended in PSR-1, we use the Tab key in VSCode to indent lines. 
It is recommended to keep lines at approximately 75-85 characters long for better code readability.

-Control Structures
These include if, for, while, switch, etc. Control statements should have one space between the control keyword and opening parenthesis, 
to distinguish them from function calls. You are strongly encouraged to always use curly braces even in situations where they are technically optional.
Eg:
    if ((condition1) || (condition2)) {
    action1;
    } elseif ((condition3) && (condition4)) {
    action2;
    } else {
    default action;
    }

-Function Calls
Functions should be called with no spaces between the function name, the opening parenthesis, and the first parameter; 
spaces between commas and each parameter, and no space between the last parameter, the closing parenthesis, and the semicolon.
Eg:
    $var = foo($bar, $baz, $quux);

-Function Definitions
Function names names MUST be declared in camelCase()

-Variable Names
Use all lower case letters
Use '_' as the word separator.
Global variables should be prepended with a 'g'.
Global constants should be all caps with '_' separators.
Static variables should be prepended with 's'.

-Database tablenames
Database table names should follow the naming convention of variable names. All lower case letters, and '_' as the word separator.

-Database fieldnames
Database fields should be named in TitleCase. This is different from the camelCase() for fucntion/method names.
